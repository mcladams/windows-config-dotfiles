What are the commands to display environmental variables in Microsoft Powershell
In Microsoft PowerShell, you can display environmental variables using the following commands:

Get-ChildItem Env: This command lists all the environment variables and their values.

powershell
Get-ChildItem Env:
$Env: This command can be used to access a specific environment variable. For example, to display the value of the PATH environment variable, you can use:

powershell
$Env:PATH
[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariables(): This command retrieves all environment variables as a dictionary.

powershell
[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariables()
These commands should help you view and manage environment variables in PowerShell. If you need more detailed information or assistance with a specific task, feel free to ask!

So there is no need to type "echo", typing any variable will display its value is that correct. Do all variables start with a $
Great questions! Let's clarify:

No need for "echo": In PowerShell, you don't need to use "echo" to display the value of a variable. Simply typing the variable name will display its value. For example:

powershell
$Env:PATH
Variables and $ symbol: Yes, in PowerShell, all variables start with a $ symbol. This includes both environment variables (like $Env:PATH) and user-defined variables (like $myVariable).

I still see some scripts and places within windows settings itself where % separated environmental variables are used e.g. %ProgramFiles% rather than... whatever the correct term is?
You're absolutely right! In Windows, environment variables can be referenced in different ways depending on the context:

PowerShell: Uses the $Env: prefix to access environment variables. For example, $Env:ProgramFiles.

Command Prompt (cmd.exe): Uses the % symbol to enclose environment variables. For example, %ProgramFiles%.

Windows Settings and Batch Files: Often use the % symbol as well. For example, %SystemRoot%.

So, when you see %ProgramFiles%, it's typically in the context of Command Prompt or batch files, whereas $Env:ProgramFiles is used in PowerShell.

If you need more details or have any other questions, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š

PS C:\Users\Mike> %ProgramFiles% %ProgramFiles%: The term '%ProgramFiles%' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
Ah, I see what happened there. In PowerShell, you can't use the % syntax like you would in Command Prompt. Instead, you should use the $Env: syntax to access environment variables. So, for example, to get the value of the ProgramFiles environment variable, you would use:

powershell
$Env:ProgramFiles
This will correctly display the value of the ProgramFiles environment variable in PowerShell.

What happens if a batch file using this termininology meant for cmd.exe is run within pwsh.exe shell
Running a batch file that uses %-style environment variables (meant for cmd.exe) within the pwsh.exe (PowerShell) shell can lead to unexpected behavior. Here's what typically happens:

Batch File Execution: PowerShell can execute batch files, but it does so by invoking cmd.exe to run the batch file. This means that the %-style environment variables will be interpreted correctly within the batch file itself.

Environment Variable Syntax: Inside the batch file, %ProgramFiles% will be correctly expanded to the value of the ProgramFiles environment variable because cmd.exe handles it.

PowerShell Context: If you try to use %ProgramFiles% directly in PowerShell (outside of a batch file), it won't work because PowerShell uses the $Env: syntax for environment variables.

Here's an example to illustrate:

Batch File (example.bat):

batch
@echo off
echo %ProgramFiles%
PowerShell Command:

powershell
.\example.bat
When you run the batch file from PowerShell using the above command, cmd.exe will execute the batch file, and %ProgramFiles% will be correctly expanded.

If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š

How can I call cmd.exe in-line with the powershell commandline, to run a simple cmd.exe command. Something like > cmd.exe 'echo %ProgramFiles% ?
You can call cmd.exe in-line within the PowerShell command line to run a simple cmd.exe command by using the cmd /c syntax. Here's how you can do it:

powershell
cmd.exe /c "echo %ProgramFiles%"
This command tells PowerShell to invoke cmd.exe and execute the command specified after /c. The echo %ProgramFiles% command will be interpreted by cmd.exe, and it will correctly expand the %ProgramFiles% environment variable.

If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š

Can cmd.exe /c handle line breaks or concatenated files like in linux terminating with a forward slash > cmd.exe /c "@echo off \ echo %ProgramFiles"
In cmd.exe, you can't use a backslash (\) to concatenate lines like you can in some Unix-like shells. However, you can use the caret (^) character to achieve a similar effect. Here's how you can do it:

powershell
cmd.exe /c "@echo off ^& echo %ProgramFiles%"
The caret (^) is used as a line continuation character in cmd.exe. You can also use the & symbol to concatenate commands on the same line.

If you want to run multiple commands in a batch file, you can use the following approach:

Batch File (example.bat):

batch
@echo off
echo %ProgramFiles%
PowerShell Command:

powershell
cmd.exe /c example.bat
This way, you can handle multiple lines and commands within a batch file and execute it from PowerShell.

what is the simplest way to create a short text file (may be a batch file of a few commands one per line) from the powershell prompt. Linux, or WSL would be: $ echo "This is the first line This is the second line This is the final line" > lines.txt or more complicated with "here strings" $ cat <<EOF > print.sh #!/bin/bash echo \$PWD echo $PWD EOF What are the powershell equivalents
Creating text files in PowerShell is quite straightforward. Here are a couple of methods you can use:

Method 1: Using Out-File
You can use the Out-File cmdlet to create a text file with multiple lines:

powershell
"This is the first line`nThis is the second line`nThis is the final line" | Out-File -FilePath lines.txt
The backtick () followed byn` is used to insert a newline character.

Method 2: Using Set-Content
Another way is to use the Set-Content cmdlet:

powershell
Set-Content -Path lines.txt -Value "This is the first line`nThis is the second line`nThis is the final line"
Method 3: Using Here-Strings
For more complex scenarios, you can use a here-string:

powershell
@"
This is the first line
This is the second line
This is the final line
"@ | Out-File -FilePath lines.txt
Creating a Batch File
If you want to create a batch file with multiple commands, you can use the same methods. Here's an example using Set-Content:

powershell
Set-Content -Path example.bat -Value "@echo off`necho %ProgramFiles%`necho Hello, World!"
These methods should help you create text files or batch files directly from the PowerShell prompt. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š

    $TmpFile = New-TemporaryFile
    github-copilot-cli what-the-shell ('use powershell to ' + $args) --shellout $TmpFile
    if ([System.IO.File]::Exists($TmpFile)) {
        $TmpFileContents = Get-Content $TmpFile
        if ($TmpFileContents -ne $null) {
            Invoke-Expression $TmpFileContents
            Remove-Item $TmpFile
        }

What is the command to list installed modules and how would I "grep" the output to see if PSReadLine was included. $ Get-Module | return -name | grep "PSReadLine"
To list installed modules in PowerShell and filter the output to check if PSReadLine is included, you can use the following commands:

List Installed Modules:

powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable
Filter the Output: You can use the Where-Object cmdlet to filter the output, similar to how grep works in Unix-like systems:

powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "PSReadLine" }
Simplified Check: If you just want to check if PSReadLine is installed and get a simple output, you can use:

powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable PSReadLine
This will list the PSReadLine module if it is installed.

In powershell using correct powershell commands (not scoop linux-like tools); text file manipulation. sending a text file to a variable, iterating through it line by line, search/select/replacing text, using regex vs wildcards.An example might be search filenames in windows directory tree; or searching all my text files under a particular location for keywords, then displaying say 3 lines before and after those of interest. Sorting text lists, making them unique (no repeating lines), comparing either two text files or two multi-line variables that have been sorted and uniqued, outputting which lines are present either only in one, only in the other or common to both.
Sure, let's dive into some PowerShell commands for text file manipulation. I'll cover the following tasks:

Reading a text file into a variable

Iterating through the file line by line

Searching and replacing text using regex and wildcards

Searching filenames in a directory tree

Searching text files for keywords and displaying context lines

Sorting text lists and making them unique

Comparing two text files or multi-line variables

1. Reading a Text File into a Variable
powershell
$fileContent = Get-Content -Path "path\to\your\file.txt"
2. Iterating Through the File Line by Line
powershell
foreach ($line in $fileContent) {
    # Process each line
    Write-Output $line
}
3. Searching and Replacing Text Using Regex and Wildcards
powershell
# Using regex
$fileContent = $fileContent -replace 'pattern', 'replacement'

# Using wildcards
$fileContent = $fileContent -replace '*pattern*', 'replacement'
4. Searching Filenames in a Directory Tree
powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\path\to\directory" -Recurse -Filter "*.txt" | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Output $_.FullName
}
5. Searching Text Files for Keywords and Displaying Context Lines
powershell
$keyword = "your_keyword"
$contextLines = 3

Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\path\to\directory" -Recurse -Filter "*.txt" | ForEach-Object {
    $fileContent = Get-Content -Path $_.FullName
    for ($i = 0; $i -lt $fileContent.Length; $i++) {
        if ($fileContent[$i] -match $keyword) {
            $start = [math]::Max(0, $i - $contextLines)
            $end = [math]::Min($fileContent.Length - 1, $i + $contextLines)
            for ($j = $start; $j -le $end; $j++) {
                Write-Output $fileContent[$j]
            }
        }
    }
}
6. Sorting Text Lists and Making Them Unique
powershell
$uniqueSortedContent = $fileContent | Sort-Object | Get-Unique
7. Comparing Two Text Files or Multi-Line Variables
powershell
$fileContent1 = Get-Content -Path "path\to\file1.txt" | Sort-Object | Get-Unique
$fileContent2 = Get-Content -Path "path\to\file2.txt" | Sort-Object | Get-Unique

$onlyInFile1 = Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $fileContent1 -DifferenceObject $fileContent2 -PassThru -IncludeEqual -ExcludeDifferent
$onlyInFile2 = Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $fileContent2 -DifferenceObject $fileContent1 -PassThru -IncludeEqual -ExcludeDifferent
$commonInBoth = Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $fileContent1 -DifferenceObject $fileContent2 -PassThru -IncludeEqual -ExcludeDifferent | Where-Object { $_.SideIndicator -eq "==" }

Write-Output "Only in File 1:"
$onlyInFile1

Write-Output "Only in File 2:"
$onlyInFile2

Write-Output "Common in Both:"
$commonInBoth

Is there anything specific you'd like to do with these tools, or any particular command you're curious about?

In powershell using correct powershell commands (not scoop linux-like tools); text file manipulation. sending a text file to a variable, iterating through it line by line, search/select/replacing text, using regex vs wildcards.An example might be search filenames in windows directory tree; or searching all my text files under a particular location for keywords, then displaying say 3 lines before and after those of interest. Sorting text lists, making them unique (no repeating lines), comparing either two text files or two multi-line variables that have been sorted and uniqued, outputting which lines are present either only in one, only in the other or common to both.
Sure, let's dive into some PowerShell commands for text file manipulation. I'll cover the following tasks:

Reading a text file into a variable

Iterating through the file line by line

Searching and replacing text using regex and wildcards

Searching filenames in a directory tree

Searching text files for keywords and displaying context lines

Sorting text lists and making them unique

Comparing two text files or multi-line variables

1. Reading a Text File into a Variable
powershell
$fileContent = Get-Content -Path "path\to\your\file.txt"
2. Iterating Through the File Line by Line
powershell
foreach ($line in $fileContent) {
    # Process each line
    Write-Output $line
}
3. Searching and Replacing Text Using Regex and Wildcards
powershell
# Using regex
$fileContent = $fileContent -replace 'pattern', 'replacement'

# Using wildcards
$fileContent = $fileContent -replace '*pattern*', 'replacement'
4. Searching Filenames in a Directory Tree
powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\path\to\directory" -Recurse -Filter "*.txt" | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Output $_.FullName
}
5. Searching Text Files for Keywords and Displaying Context Lines
powershell
$keyword = "your_keyword"
$contextLines = 3

Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\path\to\directory" -Recurse -Filter "*.txt" | ForEach-Object {
    $fileContent = Get-Content -Path $_.FullName
    for ($i = 0; $i -lt $fileContent.Length; $i++) {
        if ($fileContent[$i] -match $keyword) {
            $start = [math]::Max(0, $i - $contextLines)
            $end = [math]::Min($fileContent.Length - 1, $i + $contextLines)
            for ($j = $start; $j -le $end; $j++) {
                Write-Output $fileContent[$j]
            }
        }
    }
}
6. Sorting Text Lists and Making Them Unique
powershell
$uniqueSortedContent = $fileContent | Sort-Object | Get-Unique
7. Comparing Two Text Files or Multi-Line Variables
powershell
$fileContent1 = Get-Content -Path "path\to\file1.txt" | Sort-Object | Get-Unique
$fileContent2 = Get-Content -Path "path\to\file2.txt" | Sort-Object | Get-Unique

$onlyInFile1 = Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $fileContent1 -DifferenceObject $fileContent2 -PassThru -IncludeEqual -ExcludeDifferent
$onlyInFile2 = Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $fileContent2 -DifferenceObject $fileContent1 -PassThru -IncludeEqual -ExcludeDifferent
$commonInBoth = Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $fileContent1 -DifferenceObject $fileContent2 -PassThru -IncludeEqual -ExcludeDifferent | Where-Object { $_.SideIndicator -eq "==" }

Write-Output "Only in File 1:"
$onlyInFile1

Write-Output "Only in File 2:"
$onlyInFile2

Write-Output "Common in Both:"
$commonInBoth

Can I save this message conversation with some keywords, or do you do this automatically with a suggested title/subject, how can I find this entire conversation later or on a different machine (that i'm logged into with my MS account)
Currently, I don't have the capability to save conversations or provide a way to access them later. However, you can manually save this conversation by copying the text and pasting it into a document or note-taking app.

If you want to keep track of important information or conversations, you might consider using a note-taking app like OneNote or Evernote, which can sync across devices. This way, you can access your notes from any device you're logged into with your account.

Is there a lighter version of one-note just for say markdown formated text.
Yes, there are several lightweight note-taking apps that support Markdown formatting. Here are a few options you might find useful:

Haptic: A minimalistic, lightweight, and fast note-taking app designed to be distraction-free. It's local-first and privacy-focused.

Memos: An open-source, self-hosted note-taking solution that supports Markdown syntax for enhanced formatting.

NoteFlow: A lightweight note-taking application that transforms a single Markdown file into a modern web interface where notes and tasks coexist seamlessly.

These apps should provide a more streamlined experience if you're looking for something lighter than OneNote. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
